I want to share one of the quotes included [a few months back](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/september-24-2020) in [James Clear's](https://jamesclear.com/about) weekly [3-2-1 newsletter](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1) because it has provided me with a new perspective on fighting imposter syndrome. 

For some background, Jame Clear writes about productivity-related topics on [his website](https://jamesclear.com/articles) and is the author of [_Atomic Habits_](https://jamesclear.com/books). His 3-2-1 newsletter includes:

- 3 short ideas from himself
- 2 quotes from others
- 1 question intended to get you thinking

The quote that I want to share comes from architect [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander) and is the foreword to [_Patterns of Software_ by Richard P. Gabriel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TJ9FGE/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jamesclearema-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B003TJ9FGE&linkId=5bbe96d0ee2542beb53da79c788894af) (note, I copied the link from Jame Clear's newsletter which appears to be an affiliate link if that kind of thing bothers you).

This quote simultaneously makes me feel inspired and overwhelmed.

My struggles with imposter syndrome are often the result of comparing myself to others. When I look at the success of someone else, I frequently end up feeling discouraged. I worry that I can never match their level of talent. In the quote, Christopher Alexander suggests using the work of others to inspire greatness in yourself instead. This shift in perspective aligns with the concept of [fixed versus growth mindset](https://jamesclear.com/fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset).

With a fixed mindset, you think you have inherent talent (and lack thereof). With a fixed mindset, you will believe ideas like "the person that made \<insert favorite library here\> is a natural; I could never build something like that."  

The fixed mindset mentality is highlighted perfectly in the quote. The fictional student is fixed in their belief that they will not get to a level rivaling historically significant architecture. A line that resonated with me was, "that isn't what I am trying to do." I find that when I am in a fixed mindset, my ego will often put up a defense mechanism, and I will tell myself I'm not _actually_ trying to be at the same level as some prominent developer. The truth is, I want to be a world-class developer. I want to be [so good, they can't ignore me](https://www.calnewport.com/books/so-good/).

On the other hand, [according to the author of the book on mindset](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means), with a growth mindset you believe, "talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others)." 

With a growth mindset,  when you look at someone else's work and are impressed by it, you do not believe it was the result of some innate genius. You can see the hard work they put into developing their talents. With this mindset, you can look at work that you admire and become inspired to grow your skills in a way that can produce similar work. To quote Alexander, "Once that level of standard is in their minds, they will be able to figure out, for themselves, how to do better, how to make something that is as profound as that."

Even if the standard you are hoping to achieve feels too high, Alexander states that there is immense value in simply working towards it. Whether or not achieve your goals, the journey will cause a deeper fulfillment in your work and personal life. 

I wanted to write about this quote because it is changing my perspective and relationship with imposter syndrome.  I still struggle with comparing myself to others, and it still triggers my imposter syndrome. However, I am seeking opportunities to take a step back and view things through the lens of the growth mindset.  I am using the hard work and impressive results of others to inspire myself to work hard too. When you realize that everyone works hard to get where they are, looking at someone that you believe is successful can show you that what you want to achieve is possible. I want to fight against my insecurities and imposter syndrome and instead continue working on having a growth mindset. I want to use the amazing work of those around me to fuel my passion instead of smothering it. I want to strive for greatness in my lifelong pursuit of being a better software developer and person.
