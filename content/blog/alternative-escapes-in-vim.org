#+title: Change Opinions: Alternative Escapes In Vim

In this post I provide a brief background on using alternatives to the <kbd>ESC</kdbd> key in Vim (and Vim-like emulators) as well as how my opinion as recently changed on one of the options.

When using Vi(m) (out of habit, I will be using Vim throughout this post, but I believe everything also applies to its predecessor, Vi), you will inevitably wonder, "why did they choose the escape key?" As a modal editor, you constantly switch modes during your editing sessions and, to go back into normal mode, the default key is <kbd>ESC</kdbd>.  On modern QWERTY-style keyboards, the <kbd>ESC</kdbd> in located at the top-left of the keyboard, a stretch that, for my hands, requires my left-hand away from the home row to reach. As a keyboard-driven environment, the requirement to move so far away from the home row is not ideal.

** Why did they choose the  <kbd>ESC</kdbd> key?
According to [[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Avoid_the_escape_key][Vim wiki]], the choice of the escape key was due to the keyboard layout used with the AMD-3A terminal, the terminal Vi was originally written on. With this layout, the <kbd>ESC</kdbd> key located there <kbd>TAB</kdb> is on a QWERTY keybord, a more easily accessible location.

** What I've used
History lesson aside, I was fortunate enough to be exposed to ways to [[https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Avoid_the_escape_key][avoid the escape key]] fairly early on in my Vim usage.
** Changed opinions
