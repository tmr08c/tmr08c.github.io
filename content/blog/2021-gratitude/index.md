Following current popular advice, I have been regularly prompting myself to list things I am grateful for (or excited about). I have been doing this somewhat regularly in a few different forms over the past few years. For most of 2021, I have been using the [dailies](https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#Org_002droam-Dailies) functionality provided by [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/). A draw to using a digital, text-based solution for something like this is the ability to own my data and easily process it if I wanted; afterall, it's all in text files on my machine, right?

In practice, I rarely look back and my daily entries and have never done any bulk processing or aggregate analysis. Since we are nearing the end of the year, I thought it could be interesting to use my notes spark some reflection on the past year (and give me a somewhat easy blog post topic to write about).

There are two main sections in my dailies template that could be useful for reflection analysis:

1. List of three things I am grateful for or excited about
2. Listing how I felt about the day on a scale of 1-10

While the second point is probably more interesting for trend analysis, I decided to start with the first because I knew the formatting would be more reliable for first-time parsing purposes.

## First attempt - `Org Element`

As you may expect from the project named `org-roam`, it is based on the popular Emacs package, [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/). Org Mode works with `.org` files which use a "highly flexible structured plain text file format." If you are familiar with [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) Org formating will feel familiar.

Because Org files can be structured and my daily files followed a template, I thought I would be able to lean on existing functionality from Org to extract the data I need.

If we look at my template below, we can see my gratitude list is under its own header titles "Grateful or Excited About."

```org
#+title: %<%Y-%m-%d>
#+startup: showall

* Grateful or Excited About
#+begin_comment
What are 3 things I am grateful for or excited about.
#+end_comment

1.

* Planning [0/1]
#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Target 5 Items I would like to get done today
#+END_COMMENT

- [ ]

* Notes
** Standup
*** Prep

-

*** Notes
* Reflection
** How was today?
#+BEGIN_COMMENT
On a scale of 1-10, how was yesterday?
#+END_COMMENT

%?

** What could I change or improve?
** What did I learn?
** What did I initiate?
** Who did I help?
```

Since I only needed this one section, I thought I would be able to find existing Org-related functions to give me all content under a given heading (also known as a [subtree](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/17370/emacs-what-is-a-subtree-in-org-mode-and-how-do-you-create-one) in Org).

While most Org functions, understandably, expect to be called from within an Org document itself, I was able to learn about the [Org Element API](https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html) which allows you to generate and interact with an AST of your content.

Unfortunately, after a few hours of faking my way through elisp writing, I was unable to get something that worked. I am including my work-in-progress with the hopes an emacs wizard can grace me with some knowledge (or I can use it as a starting point in the future).

```elsip
(defun tr/extract-gratitude ()
  "WIP Function to extract gratitude section from org-dailies"
  ; make it so I can run the function using M-x
  (interactive)
  ; out putput into a temp buffer for debugging
  (with-output-to-temp-buffer "*debug org fun*"
    ; get org AST for current buffer, only looking for headlines
    (org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'headline
      (lambda (headline)
        ; filter out headlines for the one that matches what we want
        (if (string= (org-element-property :raw-value headline) "Grateful or Excited About")
            ; for our matching header, get the list of items we are gateful for
            (org-element-map (org-element-contents headline) 'plain-list
              (lambda (list)
                ; Seems like it shouldn't be necessary, but I was seeing content
                ; not nested under my header, so I tried matching again
                (if (eq (org-element-property :parent list) headline)
                     (print (org-element-contents list))
                     ; I wanted to get the content from the list, tried
                     ; mapping over each "item" in the list
                     (org-element-map (org-element-contents list) 'item
                       (lambda (item)
                         (print (org-element-contents item)))))))
          )))))

```

Not finding a straightforward "extract data from ths subtree" function was a bit surprising. Since people do some amzing things with Org Mode, I am going to assume this is a limitation of my familiarity with Org and elisp in general.

## Second Attempt - `sed`

After exceeding the time limit I set for myself to get this data, I decided to explore an option suggested in [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/n1cqlw/parse_org_files_for_header_and_email_content_like/) where the poster wanted to pull content listed under the "lessons" header of their daily org journal files. [This commentor](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/n1cqlw/comment/gwcbc5l/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) suggested getting outside of `elsip` for this task:

> That sounds like a job for an outside script (shell, Python, etc.). A simple sed / awk script will pull the text out of your org files, for example:
>
> sed -n '/^\* Lessons/,/^\*/p' dailyfiles\*.org

The suggestion was to use `sed` to pull out the data needed. Once I had the list, I could do whatever I wanted with it! Using their suggestion as a base, I eventually Googled my way into:

```bash
sed -n -E '/^\*+ Grateful or Excited About/,/\*+/{ s/^[[:digit:]]\.[[:blank:]]*(.*)$/\1/p; }' 2021-*.org
```

Let's break this down.

- The `-n` tells `sed` not to echo out each line it reads
- The `-E` flag lets us use extended regular expressions; this allows you to not escape special characters you may be used to with more modern RegEx engines (in particular, I added it when I started using match groups).
- Within our match `//`, we have two regular expressions, joined by a comma (`,`). The comma syntax tells `sed` to match on everything starting with the first regular expression, up to (and including) the second. Our two regular expressions are (1) the headling the contains my gratitude entries and (2) any following headline (a line starting with one or more `*`). The result would look like the following:

```org
* Grateful or Excited About
#+begin_comment
What are 3 things I am grateful for or excited about.
#+end_comment

1. First thing
2. another thing
3. something else

* Planning [2/2]
```

As you can see, this gets us in the right ballpark, but we still have quite a bit of content we don't need such as the headers and a comment.

- After our main search pattern (`//`), we have brackets with another command. `sed` allows you to [wrap commands between `{}` that act on the scoped output of the previous command](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html#Common-Commands). Acting on the matched output above, we match on lines that start with a digit (I am using an ordered list) and use regular expression groups to extract everything after the number.
- Our second command ends with the `/p` flag. This tells `sed` to print the match. Paired with the `-n` flag above, the only output that should be printed are our the matches from our regular expression.

After our regular expression, we use a glob expression to get all org files in the current directly that start with `2021` and pass that as an argument to `sed`, having it parse all `org` daily files form this year.

## Processing the data

Because my entries can be entered free-hand, I thought an interesting form of processing could be to categorize my entries. With less than 700 entries and the need to parse arbitrary text, I didn't think the [ROI for automation](https://xkcd.com/1205/) would work out in my favor, so I decided against attempting to script this part.

```bash
â€º sed -n -E '/^\*+ Grateful or Excited About/,/\*+/{ s/^[[:digit:]]\.[[:blank:]]*(.*)$/\1/p; }' 2021-*.org | wc -l
     671
```

Instead, I decided to pipe the results in the file and use Excel (well, actually Numbers), to help me process the data.

```bash
sed -n -E '/^\*+ Grateful or Excited About/,/\*+/{ s/^[[:digit:]]\.[[:blank:]]*(.*)$/\1/p; }' 2021-*.org > 2021-gratitude.csv
```

Despite being a single column, using the `csv` extension is a nice way to get my spreadsheet program to make things line up for me. I also know that I can use the same program to do things like generate visual representations of my data.

After going through the first few rows I began to identify most categories and notice common words in similar entries. I then used a `LOOKUP` function in `Nummbers` and a match table to match some of the more common entries I had. The `LOOKUP` function and existing categories providing a decent starting point. I hand-reviewed each entry, re-categorizing as needed.

### Takeaways

I expected the aggregate of the data to be more useful than the individual, but, since I had to go through each record to categorize anyway I realized it was more impactful to read the actual entries. There were few enough entries that this was not a time-consuming task and I was observe trends without having to use my categories. Reading the actual entries also triggered memories of what was going on at the time - from big events (job hunting, the passing of my dog) to small highlights (picking up croissants for breakfast), I got a simple peak into the things that on my mind.

Below are some of my major takeaways.

- Overusing answers

There were a number of go-to items on my list - my partner, being excited about an upcoming weekend (or grateful the past weekend was pleasant), and coffee to name a few. While I am grateful for these things, I am unsure if I am over-using them as easy answers. I suspect there may be value in finding gratitude in a wider variety of things, especially if this means taking more time out of the day to think about what I am grateful for.

- Professional life

I am lucky to include work on my list. While I joined a new team this year, I also had pre-new job entries about being grateful for my job. My switch to a new role was to have the opportunity to work in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). This is something I have wanted to do for years, so it's no surprise I have entries about being grateful for my new role, getting to work in Elixir, and Elixir (and the ecosystem) in general.

Truly, my gratitude goes out not only to everyone that makes Elixir possible, but also to all open source maintainers across languages. Open source software is amazing, but it still seems there is an opportunity to make it more sustainable for maintainers.

- Conflicted gratitude

These last few years have been extremely difficult for much of the world. They have been especially difficult for those in marginalized groups. I am torn by my "life / lucky / fortune" category (and some of the answer in my "ease of life" category); I hope that it is a good thing I am more aware of the fortunes of my life and acknowledge my gratitude towards them, but I can't help but feel bad for others when I think of how lucky I am.

## Conclusion

Taking time to reflect on the past year felt valuable. Despite taking the time to list what I am grateful for, I don't often think about what that means in the big picture. It had become another item on the TODO list that I simply want to check off. Reviewing the list not only helped me to take a step back and think about the past year, but it has also renewed my faith in the value of continuing this practice going forward.

In addition to the value of reflection, I also found it valuable from a technical perspective. I do not spend nearly enough time attempting to write code for this sort of, one-off task and, when I do, often choose a more known path. Exploring new areas (elsip, Org Element API) and failing to come up with a first-pass solution is a valuable practice in personal-time coding. It was also great to end up with a `sed`-based solution; `sed` is one of those Unix, command-line tools that are useful to have a basic knowledge of.
