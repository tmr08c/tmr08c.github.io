Last month, I became one of the more than 100,000 U.S-based technology workers that have been laid off<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>. As a fan of resources like [Getting Things Done](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done) and [The Checklist Manifesto](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6667514-the-checklist-manifesto), when faced with important projects like finding a new job I quickly turn to strategies such having a daily checklist. In this post, I share the daily checklist I used, hoping it can be useful for others in a similar situation.

## Starting the day

My first few tasks are similar to my normal, working-mode morning checklist: creating a new [org-roam daily file](https://www.orgroam.com/manual.html#org_002droam_002ddailies) and clearing my task manager&rsquo;s inbox (a la GTD).

- Create new daily roam node

  My daily file serves multiple purposes, included being a [gratitude journal](file:///2021/12/2021-gratitude/), a todo list, and a holding area for notes. Keeping this task in my daily list ensure I keep up with my gratitude practice and help me track the top tasks for the day.

- Clear inbox

  Clearing the inbox is a GTD-standard. I capture tasks throughout the day and use this time to properly process them such as adding due dates or tags and putting into the proper project.

## Identify what to do

My next batch of tasks are around identifying what is important to do for the day. These tasks were hyper-focused around two goals: handling offboarding from my old job and looking for a new job.

- Check `waiting` tag

  This is another carry-over from my normal morning checklist and another core concept in the GTD space. The idea is that you track any &ldquo;open loops&rdquo; in which you are waiting on someone else. Examples include: waiting for HR to send information on how to rollover a 401(k) or waiting for a recruiter to share information about a company they are working with.

- Review “unemployment” perspective

  The use of &ldquo;perspective&rdquo; comes from using [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) as my task manager. Perspectives are saved filters, so this is basically saying &ldquo;show me all tasks in my &lsquo;unemployment&rsquo; folder.&rdquo;

  This included projects such as rolling over my 401(k), figuring out insurance, submitting coding exercies, and keeping up with my teammates that were also laid off.

- Review “offboarding with old job” project file

  Somewhat redundant with the previous task, I had a file in which I was collecting useful information related to offboarding with my old job. While my task manager had the task I needed to do, this file would include the details of _how_ to do it.

  For example, for my 401(k) roll over project, my task manager has tasks such as &ldquo;figure out if I can do a direct roll over&rdquo; and &ldquo;send checks into IRA account&rdquo; and my project file includes links to resources about roll overs, notes from calls with the 401(k) management company, and account numbers.

- Review “new CPower job search” project file

  Similar to above, I found my task manager wasn&rsquo;t ideal for tracking my application process on its own, so I leveraged an Org mode file for tracking where I&rsquo;ve applied, including notes on interviews and a top-level table tracking the next important date.

  I would review this file in the morning and:

  - create tasks as necessary

        For example, I may have made a note during an interview the day before that I should get more familiar with a topic that came up during the conversation.

  - update my application status

        I had top-level table tracking the &ldquo;status&rdquo; of my application with each company. I would update this to the current status (e.g., waiting for feedback after an interview)

Org mode is definitely not necessary; I was essentially doing a text-file-based version of [Trello](https://trello.com/).

- Check `jobs` tag in elfeed

  I found a few RSS feeds that I could use to track new job opportunities. I would use Elfeed, an Emacs RSS reader, to check for new posts form these sources.

  Because I was specifically searching for roles in the Elixir-space, these are not widely useful, but I&rsquo;ll share them here for other Elixirists:

  - [ElixirJobs Board](https://elixirjobs.net/rss)
  - [Elixir Forum - Jobs Board](https://elixirforum.com/c/work/elixir-jobs/16.rss)

## Conclusion

I hope these tasks and some of the practices I used can be helpful for others in the job-searching process. Please reach out if there are any aspects of the process that you would like to learn more about. Best of luck to everyone job searching!
