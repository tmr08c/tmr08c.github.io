Recently, I have found that I have been using GitHub in a few new and different ways than I have in the fast. On a recent podcast (ADD SYNTAX LINK HERE), I heard host [Scott Tolinski](https://scotttolinski.com/) mention similar usage, so I thought maybe there was something to it.

Historically, I would mostly follow people I knew through work or Meetups. I would periodically star projects that looked interesting, but rarely revisited my starts, so

## The Change

My usage changes started with more gratuitously following users and starring repositories. This initial change in behavior started as I began to seek out Emacs configurations.

Due to the malleability and variation in usage patterns of Emacs, no two configurations are the same. I expect my usage pattern of Emacs to change over time and I want to have inspiration and references to look it, so I decided to star repos with Emacs config as I came across them. With the release of [lists](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-12-09-lists-are-now-available-as-a-public-beta/), I could "tag" the repositories I was starring as being Emacs related. This alleviates one of the problems of managing starts - by default, they are all mixed together. For the specific use case of trying to find Emacs config, I could filter my list for repositories contraining `emacs-lisp`, but this can be difficult in the general use case. Now, I can have an `emacs` list that contains config and interesting packages (I could even split this up if it becomes unmanageable).

## GitHub Renforcement

Historically, I have leveraged bookmarks/history and Chrome's autofill to take me to my primary project, but as more frequent starring turned into more frequent following, I somehow found myself on my GitHub feed. When I followed fewer people and starred fewer repositories, my feed didn't provide much new information - it would mostly show information about my coworkers pushing code, something the pull request tab would tell me in a more useful way. However, now I may see that someone I followed starred an interesting project or learn about a new release for a project. This information was game changing, but helped feed into the cycle of following more projects and people.

I found I started looking at the feed page enough to actually click on the `For you (beta)` tab and use [GitHub's new feed](https://github.blog/2022-03-22-improving-your-github-feed/). Building upon the existing feed, the new feed seems to provide more second-order information. For example, it will suggest people and repositories to follow. I am assuming these suggestions are based on other people are repositories that I follow. The suggestions can then feed into another rounds - whether or not I engage with the suggestions, I am providing feedback that could be used to update my feed in the future.

The new feed is also more visually pleasant to view - there isn't a massive difference, but small changes like stacked or side-by-side cards provide a touch of welcome variation.

## Social Media Feed

The self-fulfilling nature of the changes raise a slight alarm in my mind...is GitHub (or the evil M$ overlords) trying to keep my scrolling through an infinite feed as though they were a social media platform?

Maybe.

The social aspect of GitHub is not new. In the early days, [their tagline was "Social Coding"](https://1000logos.net/github-logo/). Social media was big then, people even used to admit to using Facebook. Jokes aside, the tagline made sense. GitHub made it easier to work on code with other people. Not only could you share access to code, but they also supported following other users and even used to have the [ability to DM people!](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12687679)).

While [the open source community has had a positive impact on me](/2022/04/open-source-open-eyes/) I definitely [do not want GitHub to become a full blown social media platform](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2018/08/23/a-brief-summary-of-the-social-media-reform-movement/).

I am often naive and sometimes optimistic, but I know companies improve their products because it can help them get and keep customers (which helps them make more money). I know GitHub gets value in having more people use their system. I can even see how, by following more developers and seeing more projects, you may get the feeling that everyone codes on GitHub, and not look at any other [code](https://about.gitlab.com/) [hosting](https://gitea.io/en-us/) [providers](https://bitbucket.org/product)? With this all in mind, I think this could be a [win-win-win](https://thefab20s.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/win-win-win-michael-scott-the-office.gif) situation. GitHub wins by increasing their network effect, GitHub users win by learning about interesting projects, and project creators win by getting exposure to their work (the feed will even highlight users and projects seeking sponsorship).

Something else to note about this feed is that I haven't found that it rapidly changes or provides value in checking it every day. In fact, the GitHub-generated recommendations have been pretty consistent. I think this feed lends itself well to [Cal Newport's advice](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2017/10/02/are-you-using-social-media-or-being-used-by-it/) of limiting interations to a fixed schedule. I doubt you need to get as formal as scheduling checking this feed, but I reference the idea to say, you would probably get all the value you need from the feed if you looked at it for a few minutes once a week.

## Conclusion

If you've been using GitHub for a while, you may have found your feed redundant and your list of stars difficult to manage and not revisited these features. GitHub _has_ been revisiting these features and in, what I've fond to be, positive ways.

While working on this post, I realized that this reads as though I am doing content marketing for GitHub.

# TODO

- find GH in wayback where they walked about social network for devs
- Once you pop, the fun don't stop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmpQTpY76yI (from emacs to others)
