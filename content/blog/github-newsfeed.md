Recently, I have found that I have been using GitHub in a few new and different ways than I have in the past. On a recent podcast (ADD SYNTAX LINK HERE), I heard host Scott T. (ADD LINK HERE) mention similar usage, so I thought maybe there was something to it.

My usage changes started with bring more gratuitous in who I followed and the repositories I starred. This initial change in behavior started as I began to seek out Emacs configurations. Due to the maliability and variation in usage patterns of Emacs, no two configurations are the same. I expect my usage pattern of Emacs to change over time and I want to have inspiration and references to look it, hence the increase in starring.

## Past usage?

## GH Reinforcement

- star labels/groups (this may have already existed when I started)
- explore tab

# TODO

- find GH in wayback where they walked about social network for devs
- Once you pop, the fun don't stop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmpQTpY76yI (from emacs to others)
