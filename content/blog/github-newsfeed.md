Recently, I have found that I have been using GitHub in a few new and different ways than I have in the past. On a recent podcast (ADD SYNTAX LINK HERE), I heard host Scott T. (ADD LINK HERE) mention similar usage, so I thought maybe there was something to it.

Historically, I would mostly follow people I knew through work or Meetups. I would periodically star projects that looked interesting, but rarely revisited my starts, so

## The Change

My usage changes started with more gratuitously following users and starring repositories. This initial change in behavior started as I began to seek out Emacs configurations. Due to the malleability and variation in usage patterns of Emacs, no two configurations are the same. I expect my usage pattern of Emacs to change over time and I want to have inspiration and references to look it, hence the increase in starring. With the release of [lists](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-12-09-lists-are-now-available-as-a-public-beta/), I could "tag" the repositories I was starring as being Emacs related. The possibility of being able to easily find the repositories I starred

## Past usage?

## GH Reinforcement

- star labels/groups (this may have already existed when I started)
- explore tab

## Conclusion

If you've been using GitHub for a while, you may have found your feed redundant and your list of stars difficult to manage and not revisited these features. GitHub _has_ been revisiting these features. While I [do not want GitHub to become a social media platform](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2018/08/23/a-brief-summary-of-the-social-media-reform-movement/), I have found the after starring and following more people I can get exposure to a wider variety of project and happenings in the open source space.

# TODO

- find GH in wayback where they walked about social network for devs
- Once you pop, the fun don't stop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmpQTpY76yI (from emacs to others)
