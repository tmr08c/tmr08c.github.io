At work, we have been developing a mentorship and training program to help provider our more junior team members time for [deliberate practice](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2010/01/06/the-grandmaster-in-the-corner-office-what-the-study-of-chess-experts-teaches-us-about-building-a-remarkable-life/). Our team's primary applications are built using Ruby on Rails, but we increasing our usage of React as well. Since we have a polyglot stack, we will often discuss topics by comparing Ruby to JavaScript (Elixir often makes its way into discussions as well ðŸ’œ). A recent Ruby discussion led to reviewing the Ruby "splat" operator and comparing it to [spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) in JavaScript.

In this post, I'll cover the different ways these operators can be use and how to use them in both Ruby and JavaScript.
