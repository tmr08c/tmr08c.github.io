After reading his excellent book, [_Atomic Habits_](https://jamesclear.com/books), I decided to sign up for [James Clear's](https://jamesclear.com/about) weekly [3-2-1 Newsletter](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1). The newsletter is named because it contains:

* 3 short ideas from James Clear
* 2 quotes from others
* 1 question that is intended to get you thinking

One of the quotes included [a few months back](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/september-24-2020) stuck out to me as new perspective on imposter's syndrome. The quote comes from architect [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander) and is the foreword to [Patterns of Software by Richard P. Gabriel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TJ9FGE/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jamesclearema-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B003TJ9FGE&linkId=5bbe96d0ee2542beb53da79c788894af) (_note:_ I copied the link from Jame Clear's newsletter which appears to be an affiliate link if that kind of thing bothers you):

This quote simulatneously makes me feel inspired and overwhelmed. 

I believe that my personal struggles with imposter syndrome are often the result of comparing myself to others. I look at the success of others and feel I could never compete and feel discouraged. However, in the quote, Christopher Alexander is suggesting to not be dicouraged by this high bar, but to instead use it as a driving force. 

This reminds me of the concept of [fixed versus growth mindset](https://jamesclear.com/fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset). 

The idea is that with a fixed mindset you believe you have inherit talent (and lack thereof). With a fixed mindset, you will believe ideas like "the person that made \<insert favorite library here\> is a natrual, I could never build something like that." This is highlighted perfectly in the quote - the fictional student is fixed in the belief that they will not get to a level rivaling historically great architecture. Something that rings scarily true is the line "that isn't what I am trying to do." I find that when I am in fixed mindset mode, I will often put up a defense mechanism and tell myself I'm not actually trying to be at the same level of some great developer. The truth is, I want to be a world-class developer. I want to be [so good, they can't ignore me](https://www.calnewport.com/books/so-good/).

On the other hand, with a growth mindset you believe "talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others)" ([source](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means)). With this mindset, you can look at a work that you admire and become inspired to grow your skills in a way that can produce similar work. Something from the quote that is interesting is the idea that growing these skills is rewarding, even if you never attain the skills: "It (the work) is deeper, it never gets tiresome or boring, because one can never really attain this standard."

I believe Alexander is promoting a growth mindset with this quote and is suggesting to use the work of others to fuel this mindset. While I sturggle with comparing my self to others PICK UP HERE

In a field like development, it's important to be prepared to constantly be learning; for many it is the make or break part of the software developer career. If, in your fixed mindset moments this idea overwhelms you, that is okay. In an [HBR article](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means) Carol Dweck, the author of [_Mindset: The New Psychology of Success_](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322) where this concept comes from, says:

> Everyone is actually a mixture of fixed and growth mindsets, and that mixture continually evolves with experience. A “pure” growth mindset doesn’t exist (...)

Dweck says the mixture of mindsets evolves with experience. I would venture a guess that there are also daily ebbs and flows of these mindsets as well. Like [decision fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue) and [ego depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion) I would assume that it is natrual for your mind's ability to remain in a growth mindset can be "used up" during certain periods.
