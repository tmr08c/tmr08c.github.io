After reading his excellent book, [_Atomic Habits_](https://jamesclear.com/books), I decided to sign up for [James Clear's](https://jamesclear.com/about) weekly [3-2-1 Newsletter](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1). The newsletter is named because it contains:

* 3 short ideas from James Clear
* 2 quotes from others
* 1 question that is intended to get you thinking

 Architect Christopher Alexander on the importance of high standards: 

 > "In my life as an architect, I find that the single thing which inhibits
 > young professionals, new students most severely, is their acceptance of
 > standards that are too low. If I ask a student whether her design is as good
 > as Chartres, she often smiles tolerantly at me as if to say, “Of course not,
 > that isn’t what I am trying to do. ... I could never do that.”
> 
> Then, I express my disagreement, and tell her: “That standard must be our
> standard. If you are going to be a builder, no other standard is worthwhile.
> That is what I expect of myself in my own buildings, and it is what I expect
> of my students.”
> 
> Gradually, I show the students that they have a right to ask this of
> themselves, and must ask this of themselves. Once that level of standard is
> in their minds, they will be able to figure out, for themselves, how to do
> better, how to make something that is as profound as that.
> 
> Two things emanate from this changed standard. First, the work becomes more
> fun. It is deeper, it never gets tiresome or boring, because one can never
> really attain this standard. One’s work becomes a lifelong work, and one
> keeps trying and trying. So it becomes very fulfilling, to live in the light
> of a goal like this.
> 
> But secondly, it does change what people are trying to do. It takes away from
> them the everyday, lower-level aspiration that is purely technical in nature,
> (and which we have come to accept) and replaces it with something deep, which
> will make a real difference to all of us that inhabit the earth."
