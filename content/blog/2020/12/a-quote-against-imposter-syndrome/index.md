I want to share one of the quotes included [a few months back](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1/september-24-2020) in [James Clear's](https://jamesclear.com/about) weekly [3-2-1 newsletter](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1).  It stuck out to me because it to provided me with a new perspective for fighting imposter syndrome. 

For some background, Jame Clear is the author of [_Atomic Habits_](https://jamesclear.com/books) and writes about productivity-related topics on [his website](https://jamesclear.com/articles). His 3-2-1 newsletter includes:

* 3 short ideas from James Clear
* 2 quotes from others
* 1 question that is intended to get you thinking

The quote that I want to share comes from architect [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander) and is the foreword to [_Patterns of Software_ by Richard P. Gabriel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TJ9FGE/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=jamesclearema-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B003TJ9FGE&linkId=5bbe96d0ee2542beb53da79c788894af) (_note:_ I copied the link from Jame Clear's newsletter which appears to be an affiliate link if that kind of thing bothers you).

This quote simultaneously makes me feel inspired and overwhelmed.

I believe that my struggles with imposter syndrome are often the result of comparing myself to others. I look at the success of others and feel as though I could never match their level of work. This usually leaves me discouraged. In the quote, however, Christopher Alexander is suggesting to not be discouraged by this high bar, but to instead use it as a driving force. This glass half full way of comparison reminds me of the concept of [fixed versus growth mindset](https://jamesclear.com/fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset).

With a fixed mindset, you believe you have inherent talent (and lack thereof). With a fixed mindset, you will believe ideas like "the person that made \<insert favorite library here\> is a natural; I could never build something like that." This is highlighted perfectly in the quote - the fictional student is fixed in the belief that they will not get to a level rivaling historically great architecture. Something that rings scarily true is the line "that isn't what I am trying to do." I find that when I am in a fixed mindset mode, I will often put up a defense mechanism and tell myself I'm not _actually_ trying to be at the same level as some great developer. The truth is, I want to be a world-class developer. I want to be [so good, they can't ignore me](https://www.calnewport.com/books/so-good/).

On the other hand, with a growth mindset you believe "talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others)" ([source](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means)). When you look at the work through the lens of a growth mindset, you see the hard work people put into developing their talents. With this mindset, you can look at a work that you admire and become inspired to grow your skills in a way that can produce similar work. Something from the quote that is interesting is the idea that growing these skills in and of itself is rewarding, even if you never attain the desired pinnacle: "It (the work) is deeper, it never gets tiresome or boring, because one can never really attain this standard."

A subtly I misunderstood originally from the quote is that the comparison is not between people, but the output of the work: "whether her **design** is as good as Chartes". My initial interpretation was that Chartres was a famous architect. However, it seems Alexander is referencing the [Chartres Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartres_Cathedral). 

While, in practice, I often find my brain will jump from comparing the work to comparing my self-worth to the other person, I think this distinction is important and something worth focusing on. When you focus your comparison on other people, you are more likely to revert to a fixed mindset. You can fall into the trap of feeling the other person was born with their talents. You are idealizing the person. Instead, dissect the work and talent required to produce that caliber of work. This is similar to the advice you may hear about giving good code review, try to focus on the output rather than the person. This small change in perspective can make a world of difference. We are more comfortable changing our code than ourselves. For anyone developing more than a few months, you've probably seen your coding style change and improve multiple times over and can more easily accept the idea of making changes to your coding style.

I believe Alexander is promoting a growth mindset with this quote and is suggesting to use the work of others to fuel this mindset. While I struggle with comparing myself and find it often triggers my imposter syndrome, I can also see how, with a growth mindset, it can inspire. When you realize that everyone works hard to get where they are, looking at someone that you believe is successful should show you that what you want to achieve is possible. I wanted to write about this quote because it is helping me change my perspective. I want to fight against my insecurities and imposter syndrome, and instead continue working on having a growth mindset. I want to use the amazing work of those around me to fuel my passion instead of smothering it. I want to strive for greatness in my lifelong pursuit of being a better software developer and person.
