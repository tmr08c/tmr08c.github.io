At the time of writing, many people across the world are forced to work from home as a result of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic). This sudden transition to working from home is a huge change for most. There is, however, a number of people for which remote working is a part of their normal daily life. Fortunately for those of us that are experiencing this as new territory, those with experience are sharing their knowledge.  

There are a number of common lessons out there such as making sure to still change clothes for work and making a point to share your video on calls with co-workers. One of the topics that I've been thinking about a lot is the idea of communication and interruptions. Even when in an office I would sometimes worry about the [cost of interruptions and context switching](https://blog.rescuetime.com/context-switching/), but it was easy (and therefore common) to simply walk over to a co-worker and intterup them with a question. Since remote workers have an additional barrier to the impromptu in-person interruptions, they seem think about the idea of _how_ to communicate and the impact that could have.

A lot of this thinking was spurred from this [two](https://rework.fm/remote-work-q-a-1/) [part](https://rework.fm/remote-work-q-a-2/) Q&A session on the [Rework podcast](https://rework.fm/) (from the team at Basecamp). At Basecamp, they seem to have a bias towards asynchronous communication:

> At Basecamp our perfect-world rule of thumb is “real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time”.

[This blog post](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat/) covers some of their thinking around the pros and cons of leveraging real-time communication tools like group chat programs.

## Why asynchronous?

From what I've gathered so far, the major benefits of preferring written communication come out of improving the quality of the conversation and avoiding decreasing the quality of other work. These benefits come from:

* Giving the author more time to flesh out and express their ideas. By taking the time to write and review their thoughts, the person sharing the idea has a more fleshed out idea they are sharing with the group.
* Avoiding disrupting the work of others. It's often not necessary to immediately interrupt someone to discuss an idea. Ideally, everyone should be able to consume content at a time that works best for them.
* Giving consumers more time to digest the idea. Just like it's often not necessary to interrupt someone to share an idea, it's usually not necessary to give an immediate response. Asking a question in-person or messaging someone in Slack can make it feel like an immediate response is necessary. Give readers some time to think about your points and form thoughtful responses. If you're letting them do this on their own time (see above), then they are even more likely to provide better feedback.

Another benefit is having an "artifact" to document a discussion and decision. At work, we have started leveraging longer-form, asynchronous communication in the form of [SBARs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBAR). We are using the Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation format as the output of some of our more exploratory tickets on a new project. Since reviewers have more time to read and think about the recommendation, we have seen feedback from reviewers that changed the recommendation and saved us from going down a potentially wrong path. On top of that, we have it all written down to review in the future. We can revisit the decision making process to understand why we chose to go a certain way. I am optimistic this will be like `git blame`, but for larger decisions.

## Wanting to get better

Hearing all of the suggestions and seeing some initial benefit of preferring written communication has me working to move towards it being my default form of communication. Even when we are back in a more traditional office setting, I plan to maintain a bias towards asynchronous, written communication.

No that I am bought in on the idea of leveraging longer-form, asynchronous, written communication, I want to work to get better at it. For me better means:

* Faster - part of the benefit of this style of communication is taking the time to flesh out your thoughts, but I believe I have some opportunity around translating thoughts to words on a page more quickly.
* Clearer - with syncronous communication, if you don't make sense at first you can keep trying and iterating with the other person in real time. You lose out on this quick iteration with asyncronous communication. Ideally, taking the upfront time to flesh out the writing can help avoid these issues.
* More varied - while I keep calling it "written" communication, it doesn't have to be all text on the screen. There are times when images, charts, diagrams, etc. could be included to better communicate the point. I want to be able to leverage these additional tools when they would improve the ability to deliver my message.

One way I am trying to improve my written communication is through practice; specifically, by writing more blog posts.

## (Deliberate) Practice

As it goes with everything, it takes practice to get better. With writing, it seems common to hear a suggested form of practice being to [write every day](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-daily-routine-of-20-famous-writers-and-how-you-can-use-them-to-succeed-1603f52fbb77#:~:text=Stephen%20King%20writes%206%20pages,it's%20just%20another%20day's%20work.). For professional writers, this seems goes beyond practice and moves into job productivity territory, but I think it still shows the value of practice and routine in becoming a better writer.

While I do some non-code writing every day at work (creating tickets, writing up code reviews, etc.), I want to find opportunities to "practice" outside of doing the "real thing" at work. I am loosely trying to develop something around the idea of [deliberate practice](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2010/01/06/the-grandmaster-in-the-corner-office-what-the-study-of-chess-experts-teaches-us-about-building-a-remarkable-life/). The six traits of deliberate practice from the article are:

1. Designed to improve performance - you should be stretching beyond your abilities during practice.
1. Repetition - similar to the writers' suggestion to write everyday; deliberate practice means you are working on the task more than just when you are going the real thing.
1. Feedback - when practicing you should have external feedback readily and continuously available.
1. Mentally demanding - the article compares the "mindless" acts of practicing scales with deliberate practices which should require you to be mindful and focused.
1. Hard to do - this sort of seems redundant with number one and four, but it's sort of the end result. By doing things that stretch you to your limits and beyond and that you must focus on, you are likely going to be doing something that is difficult for you. The article specifically calls out deliberate practice is not doing something you do well and enjoy doing.
1. Driven by good goals - goals should focus on the _process_ of getting to the outcome and not just the outcome alone.

How does my current attempt at writing more through blog posts stack up against the traits of good deliberate practice?

1. Designed to improve performance - Clear and succinct long-form writing to a wider audience is currently pushing beyond my limits.
1. Repetition - I am currently working to spend about one Pomodoro of time (25 minutes) each day writing.
1. Feedback - I think this is the biggest hole I have in deliberate practice.  It seems like the ideal would be to have people review my work after each writing session. I imagine a more realistic approach would be to get some reviews on various drafts. I could start by asking people I know, but I think to really push, I would want to have a professional editor review my work and provide feedback. I do not currently have any plans around this, but it may be something I should consider if I really want to improve.
1. Mentally demanding - I do find find I need to be focused to write. There are some tasks like editing where I try to lean on tools like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to do some of the mental heavy-lifting. There may be opportunity to stay more engaged in the suggested edits and why to reduce my errors in the future.
1. Hard to do - I have found writing and editing my posts to be difficult. I often find I go into a post thinking I know what I'm going to write, but when sitting down to write struggle to get idea out in a coherent manner. Instead, I have to spend a lot of time shaping and connecting my thoughts to get an idea fully formed. I think writing posts on different things helps avoid the concern with this point - doing something you know well and enjoy isn't the type of task deliberate practice benefits from.
1. Driven by good goals - I currently don't have very clear or specific goals. I basically want to write more because I think it's a good skill to have (and I want to [build habits](https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits) that make me more like the person I think I want to be). I do aim to write for a small amount of time every day, so that may be considered focusing on the process more than the outcome.

While there is room for improvement (especially around a very key component of feedback), I think this is a good start. An important part of deliberate practice is continuning to push and stretch yourself. This means that my current practice regimen of daily, small writing sessions will likely need to change - I may need to push myself to write for longer sessions, on topics I know nothing about, or find ways to incorporate visual aids into my writing.





As a developer, there are a lot of places where writing is important (e.g., creating tickets/issues, code comments, pull request descriptions, code reviews, etc.). This increases with remote work where more communication becomes text-based. In many of these situations there is value in being accurate, including context and relevant details, and at the same time succinct (you don't want a three-hundred word comment for each method in your application).

When writing for work I find I commonly need express my thoughts or preferences, or explain a concept. Examples of this could be suggesting a certain implementing for a feature, or explains how a concept within out domain works. This aligns nicely with the types of blog posts I try to write; I generally choose topics that try to explain something technical or, like this one, share my current thoughts.


<!-- missing stuff here --> 

In a recent [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/m105-open-source-developers-inevitably-have-better/id1150826721?i=1000479280612) [Regor Bugayenko](https://www.yegor256.com/about-me.html) posited that developers that do open source work have stronger technical and "soft" skills.

Yegor's idea is that in open source, almost everyone is working with people they don't know. This means their work is judged more on the work itself and doesn't include the benefits one would receive from their friends and co-workers. In addition to judegement of the work, open source developers need the ability to run the project and communicate with the world. This includes tasks like: discussing ideas for new functionality, explaining to a contributor why their change will not be accepted, and triaging issues users create.

I believe that leveraging blogging can provide similar training to open source work.

Similar to open source work, your potential audience is the world (or at least people in the world that would benefit from your open source project or be interested in the topics you blog about). This wide audience comes with some challenges.

- You aren't going to get the benefit of writing to an audience that know your voice and tone, and how that is reflected in your writing.
- You are also writing to an audience of varying skills levels. Learning to express your thoughts succinctly, clearly, and thoroughly can be difficult to balance across different topics. 
- Writing to the wider audience means you cannot lean on some of the help you may be able to with normal coversations with your team . If someone doesn't understand your post, you probably aren't going to be able to hop on a video call with them to work it out. Even if your blog supports comments, it's unlikely confused readers will start a fruitful conversation in the comment section to help flesh our your concepts.

However, learning to write for an unfamilar audience should make writing for an audience that you know and knows you even easier. By working on developing your skills in a more difficult environment, you should find writing for your co-workers easier.

Writing for a blog does come with some advantages though. In my mind, the biggest of these is time. When writing for a personal blog, most people don't have any sort of actual publishing schedule to keep to. Having time to write, re-write, and edit can help you hone your skills. As your skills develop, you should be able to write in a more time-sensitive environment like work with the same level of quality you developed from blogging. 


- [ ] want to favpr async communication
- [ ] want to write more to practice getting my ideas out
- [ ] can find for complicated ideas, want to move towards a call or chat to rapidly get back and forth
    - this isn't all bad
    - times where could improve
    - when make a decision want to document it, so having ability to write it out is valuable
