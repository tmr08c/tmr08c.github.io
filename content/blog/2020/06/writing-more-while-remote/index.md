At the time of writing, many people across the world are forced to work from home as a result of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic). This sudden transition to working from home is a huge change for most. There is, however, a number of people for which remote working is a part of their normal daily life. Fortunately for those of us that are experiencing this as new territory, those with experience are sharing their knowledge.  

There are a number of common lessons out there such as making sure to still change clothes for work and making a point to share your video on calls with co-workers. One of the topics that I've been thinking about a lot is the idea of communication and interruptions. Even when in an office I would sometimes worry about the [cost of interruptions and context switching](https://blog.rescuetime.com/context-switching/), but it seemed more natural to turn around and ask a co-worker than to message or email them. It seems that since remote workforces have an additional barrier to the impromptu in-person interruptions, they think about the idea of _how_ to communicate and the impact that could have.

A lot of this thinking was spurred from this [two](https://rework.fm/remote-work-q-a-1/) [part](https://rework.fm/remote-work-q-a-2/) Q&A session on the Rework pocast (from the team at Basecamp). At Basecamp, they seem to have a bias towards asynronous communication:

> At Basecamp our perfect-world rule of thumb is “real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time”.

[This blog post](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat/) covers some of their thinking around the pros and cons of leveraging real-time communication tools like group chat programs. 

These discussions around the benefits of leveraging asynchronous communication have me trying to leverage it more when possible. One way I am trying to improve my written communication is through practice; specifically, by writing more blog posts.

As it goes with everything, it takes practice to get better. With writing, it seems common to hear a suggested form of practce being to [write every day](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-daily-routine-of-20-famous-writers-and-how-you-can-use-them-to-succeed-1603f52fbb77#:~:text=Stephen%20King%20writes%206%20pages,it's%20just%20another%20day's%20work.). For professional writers, this goes beyond practice and moves into job productivity territory, but I think it still shows the value of practice and routine in becoming a better writer.

As a developer, there are a lot of places where writing is important (e.g., creating tickets/issues, code comments, pull request descriptions, code reviews, etc.). This increases with remote work where more communication becomes text-based. In many of these situations there is value in being accurate, including context and relevant details, and at the same time succinct (you don't want a three-hundred word comment for each method in your application).

When writing for work I find I commonly need express my thoughts or preferences, or explain a concept. Examples of this could be suggesting a certain implemention for a feature, or explaing how a concept within out domain works. This aligns nicely with the types of blog posts I try to write; I generally choose topics that try to explain something technical or, like this one, share my current thoughts.



- [ ] want to favpr async communication
- [ ] want to write more to practice getting my ideas out
- [ ] can find for complicated ideas, want to move towards a call or chat to rapidly get back and forth
    - this isn't all bad
    - times where could improve
    - when make a decision want to document it, so having ability to write it out is valuable
