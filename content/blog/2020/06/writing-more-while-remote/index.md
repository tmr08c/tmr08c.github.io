At the time of writing, many people across the world are forced to work from home as a result of the [COVIN-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic). This sudden transition to working from home is a huge change for most. There is, however, a number of people for which remote working is a part of their normal daily life. Fortunately for those of us that are experiencing this as new territory, those with experience are sharing their knowledge.  

There are a number of common lessons out there such as making sure to still change clothes for work and making a point to share your video on calls with co-workers. One of the topics that I've been thinking about a lot is the idea of communication and interruptions. Even when in an office I would sometimes worry about the [cost of interruptions and context switching](https://blog.rescuetime.com/context-switching/), but it seemed more natural to turn around and ask a co-worker a question rather than to message or email them. It seems that since remote workforces have an additional barrier to the impromptu in-person interruptions, they think about the idea of _how_ to communicate and the impact that could have.

A lot of this thinking was spurred from this [two](https://rework.fm/remote-work-q-a-1/) [part](https://rework.fm/remote-work-q-a-2/) Q&A session on the Rework podcast (from the team at Basecamp). At Basecamp, they seem to have a bias towards asynchronous communication:

> At Basecamp our perfect-world rule of thumb is “real-time sometimes, asynchronous most of the time”.

[This blog post](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat/) covers some of their thinking around the pros and cons of leveraging real-time communication tools like group chat programs.

From what I've gathered so far, the major benefits of preferring written communication come out of improving the quality of the conversation and avoiding decreasing the quality of other work (by avoiding interruptions).

* Giving the author more time to flesh out and express their ideas. 
* Avoding disrupting the work of others. It's often not necessary to immediately interrupt someone to discuss an idea. Ideally, they should be able to consume your content at a time that works best for them.
* Giving consumers more time to digest the idea. ust like it's often not necessary to intterrupt someone to share an idea, it'usually not necessary to give an immediate response. With chat communication it can feel that way, though. Give readers some time to think about your points and form thoughtful responses. If you're letting them do this on their own time (see above), then they are even more likely to provide better feedback.

These discussions around the benefits of leveraging asynchronous communication have me trying to leverage it more when possible. One way I am trying to improve my written communication is through practice; specifically, by writing more blog posts.

As it goes with everything, it takes practice to get better. With writing, it seems common to hear a suggested form of practice being to [write every day](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-daily-routine-of-20-famous-writers-and-how-you-can-use-them-to-succeed-1603f52fbb77#:~:text=Stephen%20King%20writes%206%20pages,it's%20just%20another%20day's%20work.). For professional writers, this goes beyond practice and moves into job productivity territory, but I think it still shows the value of practice and routine in becoming a better writer.

As a developer, there are a lot of places where writing is important (e.g., creating tickets/issues, code comments, pull request descriptions, code reviews, etc.). This increases with remote work where more communication becomes text-based. In many of these situations there is value in being accurate, including context and relevant details, and at the same time succinct (you don't want a three-hundred word comment for each method in your application).

When writing for work I find I commonly need express my thoughts or preferences, or explain a concept. Examples of this could be suggesting a certain implementing for a feature, or explaing how a concept within out domain works. This aligns nicely with the types of blog posts I try to write; I generally choose topics that try to explain something technical or, like this one, share my current thoughts.


<!-- missing stuff here --> 

In a recent [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/m105-open-source-developers-inevitably-have-better/id1150826721?i=1000479280612) [Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.yegor256.com/about-me.html) posited that developers that do open source work have stronger technical and "soft" skills.

Yegor's idea is that in open source, almost everyone is working with people they don't know. This means their work is judged more on the work itself and doesn't include the benefits one would receive from their friends and co-workers. In addition to judegement of the work, open source developers need the ability to run the project and communicate with the world. This includes tasks like: discussing ideas for new functionality, explaining to a contributor why their change will not be accepted, and triaging issues users create.

I believe that leveraging blogging can provide similar training to open source work.

Similar to open source work, your potential audience is the world (or at least people in the world that would benefit from your open source project or be interested in the topics you blog about). This wide audience comes with some challenges.

- You aren't going to get the benefit of writing to an audience that know your voice and tone, and how that is reflected in your writing.
- You are also writing to an audience of varying skills levels. Learning to express your thoughts succinctly, clearly, and thoroughly can be difficult to balance across different topics. 
- Writing to the wider audience means you cannot lean on some of the help you may be able to with normal coversations with your team . If someone doesn't understand your post, you probably aren't going to be able to hop on a video call with them to work it out. Even if your blog supports comments, it's unlikely confused readers will start a fruitful conversation in the comment section to help flesh our your concepts.

However, learning to write for an unfamilar audience should make writing for an audience that you know and knows you even easier. By working on developing your skills in a more difficult environment, you should find writing for your co-workers easier.

Writing for a blog does come with some advantages though. In my mind, the biggest of these is time. When writing for a personal blog, most people don't have any sort of actual publishing schedule to keep to. Having time to write, re-write, and edit can help you hone your skills. As your skills develop, you should be able to write in a more time-sensitive environment like work with the same level of quality you developed from blogging. 


- [ ] want to favpr async communication
- [ ] want to write more to practice getting my ideas out
- [ ] can find for complicated ideas, want to move towards a call or chat to rapidly get back and forth
    - this isn't all bad
    - times where could improve
    - when make a decision want to document it, so having ability to write it out is valuable
