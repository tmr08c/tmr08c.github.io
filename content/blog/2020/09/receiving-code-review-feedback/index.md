Code reviews are a common topic among blog posts and videos. This is for a good reason - code reviews are powerful tool for spreading knowledge, improving code quality, and, when done right, can strengthen team bonds.

Often, content around code reviews is focused on how to _give_ a good code reivew. In the post, I want to cover how to manage being on the _receiving_ end.

If you are interested in content on giving a good code review, I recommend the talk [_Implementing a Strong Code-Review Culture_](https://youtu.be/PJjmw9TRB7s) by Derek Prior. It is a great overall introduction to code reviews with a strong focus on how to give a code review that can be well received. It has been hugely impactful on how I give code reviews.

## You are not your code

A blog post about being on the receiving end a code review may seem surperfulous; all you have to do is put the code up and wait for the review, right? Not when our sneaky friend, ego gets involved.

In a worst case scenario (and the reason there is so much content on how to give better code reviews), they can feel like (or actually be) personal attacks. In a best case scenario, code reviews are a form of receiving feedback on your work.

If you have your ego tied into the code you wrote, even a well-intentioned code review can feel like a personal attack. If they don't like the way your wrote this line of code...do they not like you? Do they think you don't deserve to be on the team? While this jump from a comment on a line of code to worrying about job security can feel over-the-top, I have experienced these emotional overreactions.

I believe as "knowledge workers," our worth can feel closely tied to the knowledge we bring. When tied too closely, a lack of knowledge can feel like a like of worth.

On top of tying our worth into the correctness of our code, writing code also has an artistic element to it. Different developers have different styles and aesthetic preferences (for the code). Even when trying to be rational and Spock-like about the functionality of code, sometimes feedback can be about more "artistic" choices you have made.



1. Review your own code first
  * This puts you in the mindset of looking for issues with the code
1. Assume best intention
  * It's a team effort
  * Maybe someone was in a rush and wanted to get comments out
1. Step away
  * Try to develop some mental separation
  * Possibly starting on other work
  * Time allowing, can help reset mindset of wanting to get a quick approval
1. Reframe the goal of code reviews - not to get approval, but to improve code and learn
