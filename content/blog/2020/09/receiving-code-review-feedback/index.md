Code reviews are an important part of the software development lifecycle on a team and a common topic among blog posts and videos. This is for a good reason - code reviews are powerful tool for spreading knowledge, improving code quality, and, when done right, can strengthen team bonds.

Often, content around code reviews is how to give a good code reivew. In the post, I want to cover how to manage being on the receiving end.

If you are interested in good content on giving a good code review I recommend the talk [_Implementing a Strong Code-Review Culture](https://youtu.be/PJjmw9TRB7s) by Derek Prior. It is a great overall introduction to code reviews with a strong focus on how to give a code review that can be well received. It has been hugely impactful on how I give code reviews.

1. Review your own code first
  * This puts you in the mindset of looking for issues with the code
1. Assume best intention
  * It's a team effort
  * Maybe someone was in a rush and wanted to get comments out
1. Step away
  * Try to develop some mental separation
  * Possibly starting on other work
  * Time allowing, can help reset mindset of wanting to get a quick approval
1. Reframe the goal of code reviews - not to get approval, but to improve code and learn
