My friend and former co-workers [@C-Saunders](https://github.com/c-saunders) and I make a point to periodically catch up with each other. During these sessions we often talk shop. We share a similar background in that we the bulk of our careers thus far have been with the same company and both recently began at new companies. It's been great to compare and contrast our past lives and our new lives. I've really appreciated these sessions and have found them to be a great way to keep up with a friend and also get more exposure to the software development world. 

During our most recent discssion we discussed two different spectrums; they stuck out to me because for both of these spectrums we had words that began with the same word. For some reason this seesaw symmetry made me want to write them down when we were talking. The two spectrums we discusssed were: 

* Balancing being **pragmatic** and being **prudent**
* Knowing when it's time to **struggle** and when it's time to **solve**

To me, these are both examples of spectrums that I regularly shift positions on, often without actively thinking about where I land. 

## Pragmatic versus Prudent

* [**Pragmatic**](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/pragmatic) - dealing with things sensibly and realistically in a way that is based on practical rather than theoretical considerations.
* [**Prudent**](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/prudent) - acting with or showing care and thought for the future.

I believe most people in the software industry would be familar with trying to balance these two ends of the spectrums. We want to build solid, reliable systems that scale, but we also want to avoid [premature optimization](https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization) and building things [we aren't going to need](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html). We want to learn new things to grow and be future-proof, but [maybe the hype _isn't_ real?](https://blog.daftcode.pl/hype-driven-development-3469fc2e9b22) (ignore what that article says about Elixir and Phoenix, they **are** the real deal ðŸ˜»).

I try to keep the idea of [perfect being the enemy of good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good) in mind, but, in the moment, it's _so_ easy to forget. I think I struggle with this the most at the meta level of thinking about my life and career. I have lists spread across numerous note taking and todo list apps abut things I want to learn more about. I greatly struggle with not wanting to miss out the next big thing, or having my skills become obsolete. Unfortunately, this overthinking and overworrying leads to [analysis paralysis](https://xkcd.com/1801/) and inaction. At this moment, I have tabs open about the new [Redwood](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood) JavaScript framework and [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/), and I had originally planned to spend the day looking into [concurrent-ruby](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby) to sharpen my Ruby skills for my new job. Instead of all of those, I'm writing a draft of this post (which may never actually see the light of day).

## Struggling versus Solving

This one is almost a most specific instance of pragmatic versus prudent, but I was so excited we had another pair of words that started with the same letter and represented two ends of a spectrum I have to make it a thing.

We were talking about how to balance spending the time struggling with a problem and learning on your own with getting to a solution. In a [recent post](/2020/04/how-i-debug-my-dependencies#asking-for-help) I mentioned how I can struggle asking for help, especially from open-source strangers, and this struggle versus solving discussion came out of that idea. However, asking for help isn't limited to reaching out to a library author, it can also be asking your co-workers for help.

Personally, I tend to fall on the side of struggling. I think there is value in taking some time to sruggle with a problem to better understand. In addition to getting practice trying to learn something, I think it helps the lessons better stick with me. However, I _know_ I have some opportunity to better balance where I fall on this spectrum.

Being a new team member has put this balance to the test for me. Working on a new, large codebase has resulted in numerous "how do I..." and "where is..." moments. For many of these I have silently struggled longer than I probably should have - grepping across multiple repositories or jumping between Confluence and GitHub. For many of these problems, I could have pinged someone and probably would have been pointed pretty quickly to the answer of my question. Fortunately, most of these problems haven't taken up too much time, but it can be a slippery slope.

Maybe the question to keep in mind is: "have I struggled enough where if I get the answer given to me, it will stick?"

## Conclusion

I don't expect this to post to reveal anything new to people; [life is about balance and moderation](https://xkcd.com/1592/) and software is full of [it depends answers](https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/766/how-to-answer-it-depends-questions). However, I think having these terms to keep in my head can provide me something to reach for when I find myself to far on one side of the scale.
