My friend and former co-workers [@C-Saunders](https://github.com/c-saunders) and I make a point to periodically catch up with each other. Because I am extremely fortunate and enjoy the industry I work in, one of my favorite parts of our conversations is discussing work. We share a similar background in that we the bulk of our careers thus far have been with the same company and we both recently began working at new companies. Having a shared background provides a solid starting point for comparing and contrasting how our new teams work. I've really appreciated these sessions and have found them to be a great way to keep up with a friend and also get more exposure to the software development world. 

During our most recent discussion, we discussed two different spectrums; they stuck out to me because for both of these spectrums we had words that began with the same word. For some reason this seesaw symmetry made me want to write them down when we were talking. The two spectrums we discussed were: 

* Balancing being **pragmatic** and being **prudent**
* Knowing when it's time to **struggle** and when it's time to **solve**

These are both examples of spectrums on which I am regularly shifting my position; often without actively thinking about where I currently stand. 

## Pragmatic versus Prudent

* [**Pragmatic**](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/pragmatic) - dealing with things sensibly and realistically in a way that is based on practical rather than theoretical considerations.
* [**Prudent**](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/prudent) - acting with or showing care and thought for the future.

I believe most people in the software industry are familiar with trying to balance these two ends of the spectrum, especially in day-to-day feature development. We want to build solid, reliable systems that scale, but we also want to avoid [premature optimization](https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization) and writing code for things [we aren't going to need](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html). I try to keep the idea of [perfect being the enemy of good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good) in mind, but, in the moment, it's _so_ easy to forget. 

Another area we may struggle with this is where we focus our attention. It makes senes to learn more about the current language or framework your using, but [maybe it's dying](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7oam8p/which_programming_language_is_dying/). We want to learn new things to grow and be future-proof, but [maybe the hype _isn't_ real?](https://blog.daftcode.pl/hype-driven-development-3469fc2e9b22) (ignore what that article says about Elixir and Phoenix, they **are** the real deal ðŸ˜»).

I think this, where should I focus my energy for the future thinking, is where I struggle the most.  I have lists spread across numerous note taking and to-do list apps abut things I want to learn more about. I greatly struggle with not wanting to miss out on the next big thing, or having my skills become obsolete. Unfortunately, this overthinking and over worrying leads to [analysis paralysis](https://xkcd.com/1801/) and inaction. At this moment, I have tabs open about the new [Redwood](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood) JavaScript framework and [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) (trying to be prudent and track upcoming trends), and I had originally planned to spend the day looking into [concurrent-ruby](https://github.com/ruby-concurrency/concurrent-ruby) to sharpen my Ruby skills for my new job (the pragmatic choice). Instead of all of those, I'm writing a draft of this post (which may never actually see the light of day).

## Struggling versus Solving

This one is almost a most specific instance of pragmatic versus prudent, but I was so excited we had another pair of words that started with the same letter and represented two ends of a spectrum I have to make it a thing.

We were talking about how to balance spending the time struggling with a problem and learning on your own with getting to a solution. In a [recent post](/2020/04/how-i-debug-my-dependencies#asking-for-help) I mentioned how I can struggle with asking for help, especially from open-source strangers, and this struggle versus solving discussion came out of that idea. However, asking for help isn't limited to reaching out to a library author, it can also be asking your co-workers for help.

Personally, I tend to fall on the side of struggling. I think there is value in taking some time to struggle with a problem to better understand. In addition to getting practice trying to learn something, I think it helps the lessons better stick with me. However, I _know_ I have some opportunity to better balance where I fall on this spectrum.

Being a new team member has put this balance to the test for me. Working on a new, large codebase has resulted in numerous "how do I..." and "where is..." moments. For many of these, I have silently struggled longer than I probably should have - grepping across multiple repositories or jumping between Confluence and GitHub. For many of these problems, I could have pinged someone and probably would have been pointed pretty quickly to the answer to my question. Fortunately, most of these problems haven't taken up too much time, but it can be a slippery slope.

Maybe the question to keep in mind is: "have I struggled enough where if I get the answer given to me, it will stick?"

## Conclusion

Unfortunately, this post isn't the kind that solve the "problem" of being too extreme to one side or the other. I also don't expect it to reveal anything new to people; [life is about balance and moderation](https://xkcd.com/1592/) and software is full of [it depends answers](https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/766/how-to-answer-it-depends-questions). However, I think having these terms can provide a tool for observing your behavior or the behavior of those you work with. Maybe the next time you dealing with a difficult problem at work you can take a step back and assess where you fall on the struggle-solve spectrum, and decide what to do next. _Maybe_ you could even work with your manager to see where they think you fall on these spectrums and where they would like you to be.
