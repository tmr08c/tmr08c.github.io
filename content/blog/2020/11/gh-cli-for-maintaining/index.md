In a [previous post](/2020/11/gh-cli-during-hacktoberfest), I mentioned using the [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) during Hacktoberfest to make it easier to contribute to projects. This year, I was also fortunate to also [participate in Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/devise-security/devise-security/issues/232) as a collaboartor on the [`devise-security`](https://github.com/devise-security/devise-security) project.

When focusing on collaborating, CLI was still incredibly useful. The command I used most was `gh pr checkout` for checking out the code related to a Pull Request. This is also my most-used CLI command for my work projects as well.
