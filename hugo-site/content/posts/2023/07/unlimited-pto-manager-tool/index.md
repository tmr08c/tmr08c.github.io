title: Unlimited PTO can be a Manager's Tool
---

While there are [pros and cons](https://www.bamboohr.com/blog/benefits-limitations-unlimited-vacation) of unlimited time off policies, I want to cover a pro that I was exposed to recently: the ability for managers to use it as a support mechanism for their team.

In a traditional system, there is often the feeling of wanting to use PTO for vacations or family plans (i.e., saving it for "fun" things). Even if you have sick days, taking a sick day for mental health reasons is still uncommon (and may come with a stigma), or you may feel the need to save them for a potential physical illness. With a finite budget of PTO, you are mindful of when and how you use it. The idea of your manager suggesting you use your PTO is almost unthinkable.

With unlimited PTO, managers can more freely suggest their team members take time off when there are signs of stress or creeping burnout. As a manager, you can often catch the early warning signs: has someone been working on a gnarly bug all week? Have they been doing a high-risk data migration for a customer? Even if they are not showing signs of fatigue or stress, you can still suggest taking some time off. With a flexible PTO policy, your suggestion is not costing them time later. Instead, you are showing your appreciation for their hard work and a commitment to their longevity with the team.

The common concern with unlimited vacation policies is underutilization; this is where management can shine. As a manager, you can regularly check in with your team to ensure they keep good time off hygiene. Moreso, you can provide additional support during times of need by promoting time off.

I want to thank my manager for sharing this concept with me and promoting that I take a mental health day when I needed one.
