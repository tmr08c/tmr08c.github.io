Unlike lists, using an empty map in pattern matching does not only match empty maps; it matches empty and populated maps.

```ex
> [] = [1,2,3]
** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: [1, 2, 3]

> %{} = %{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
%{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
```

This was a bit of a surprise for me when attempting to match an empty list, so I wanted to share how you can pattern match an empty map (aka re-write the answers I found on [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33248816/pattern-match-function-against-empty-map)).

There appear to be two primary options for matching on an empty list.

1. You can use `==` and compare it to an empty map.

```ex
def my_fun(map) when map == %{}
```

2. You can use the [`map_size/1`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.12/Kernel.html#map_size/1) guard clause and compare it to `0`.

```ex
def my_fun(map) when map_size(map) == 0
```

I was curious if there was a performance implication to either choice, so I wrote a benchmark script to compare the options.

```ex
Mix.install([:benchee])

defmodule EmptyMapMatch do
  def using_size(map) when map_size(map) == 0, do: map
  def using_size(map), do: map
  def empty_map(map) when map == %{}, do: map
  def empty_map(map), do: map
end

Benchee.run(
  %{
    "checking size" => fn input -> EmptyMapMatch.using_size(input) end,
    "matching map" => fn input -> EmptyMapMatch.empty_map(input) end
  },
  inputs: %{
    "Empty" => %{},
    "Small" => Enum.zip(1..100, 1..100) |> Enum.into(%{}),
    "Medium" => Enum.zip(1..1_000, 1..1_000) |> Enum.into(%{}),
    "Large" => Enum.zip(1..10_000, 1..10_000) |> Enum.into(%{})
  },
  time: 10
)
```

This script will use [benchee](https://github.com/bencheeorg/benchee) to compare functions with `map_size` and `==` guard clauses on four different size maps.

After a few runs with different times, I found the options were equivalent speed-wise. Here is a sample result from a ten-second benchmark.

These calls are both so quick that I would occasionally receive this warning from benchee:

> Warning: The function you are trying to benchmark is super fast, making measurements more unreliable!
> This holds especially true for memory measurements.
> See: https://github.com/PragTob/benchee/wiki/Benchee-Warnings#fast-execution-warning

I suspect that this explains why I would see the results flip-flop between runs.

I had expected `map_size` would be slower and slow down more as the input size increased, but the benchmarks show otherwise. If I had read the [documentation for `map_size`](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.12/Kernel.html#map_size/1), I could have saved myself some time.

> This operation happens in constant time.

Since both options appear to be essentially equivalent, I plan to default to using `map_size` since it provides the flexibility to check for more than just empty maps.
