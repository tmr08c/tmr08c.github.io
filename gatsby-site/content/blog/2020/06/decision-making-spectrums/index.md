My friend and former co-worker Charlie ([@C-Saunders](https://github.com/c-saunders)) and I make a point to periodically catch up with each other. Because I am lucky and enjoy the industry I work in, our discussions about work are a personal highlight.

During a recent conversation, we discussed decision making at work. We ended up examining two different "spectrums" that could impact your decision making. One of these came from his boss, and the other is something he came up with during our conversation. These ideas stuck out to me because, for both of these spectrums, we had [tautograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautogram) (word groups that begin with the same letter).

 The two spectrums we discussed were:

* Balancing being **pragmatic** and being **prudent**
* Knowing when it's time to **struggle** and when it's time to **solve**

Your position on these spectrums will vary by situation. Without acknowledging these shifts, you can fall into common pitfalls during the decision making process. Thinking about where you fall on these spectrums can be a useful thought technology for self-evaluation and help you catch yourself before you end up in one of these traps.

## Pragmatic versus Prudent

* [**Pragmatic**](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/pragmatic) - dealing with things sensibly and realistically in a way that is based on practical rather than theoretical considerations.
* [**Prudent**](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/prudent) - acting with or showing care and thought for the future.

Everyone in the software industry has dealt with trying to balance these two ends of the spectrum. We want to build solid, reliable systems that [scale](https://memegenerator.net/instance/54758622/will-it-blend-great-protoype-but-will-it-scale), but we also want to avoid [premature optimization](https://wiki.c2.com/?PrematureOptimization) and writing code for things [we aren't going to need](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html).

When dealing with day-to-day work and planning, I try to keep the idea of [perfect being the enemy of good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_is_the_enemy_of_good) in mind, but, in the moment, it's _so_ easy to forget.

### Planning

I have found the planning part of my work to be where I most often fall into a mindset of being prudent over pragmatic. I'm not going as far as a [big upfront design](https://wiki.c2.com/?BigDesignUpFront), but I do try to think out how functionality should work now and _could_ need to work in the future. This "could" thinking can be dangerous because I can't predict the future.

In a recent example, I was tasked with collecting a few specific metrics about a process an end-user goes through (e.g., who submitted this request, when they submitted it, etc.). We had a list of specific asks from the business, so things should have been straightforward. However, when I began sketching out what I wanted my schema to look like, I started thinking of other information that we _could_ be asked for. My previous experience of working at a digital marketing agency also biased me to think we would eventually want to track and report on [all the things](https://memegenerator.net/instance/67578839/x-all-the-things-track-all-the-things). This led me to start thinking of how to model a generic "event" for reporting purposes.

Fortunately, I was able to leverage stand-up the next day to signal to the team the rabbit hole I began finding myself digging down. This led to scheduling some time with a teammate to bring me into reality - we don't know _everything_, but we know _something_; we know what the business side already wants to report on. Getting started with the current request allows us to get to good and talk about perfect along the way. Maybe in a few months, we will wish we had a generic "event" model. Even if this is true, we will have delivered months of _some_ value in the interim, **and** will know more about what we really want and (more importantly) _need_ out of our reporting.

### Performing

I have found that when it comes to hands-on-keyboard, code-writing time, it can be easier to be more pragmatic.

I think some of my pragmatism with coding comes out of laziness. Asking, "do we _really_ need this?" seems to come up a lot more naturally when I have to actually _do_ something. Fortunately, [some consider this to be a  virtue](http://threevirtues.com/).

I've also found that some industry practices lend themselves to guide me towards making pragmatic decisions during the coding phase. One great example of this is the idea of [red-green-refactor](https://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/Red-Green-Refactor.html). When disciplined in this approach, you will maintain a focus on doing "just enough." You write just enough test to fail, and then just enough logic to make that test pass. Every once in a while, you change things just enough to make the codebase easier to work with.


### Being Agile

Looking at the [Agile Manifesto](
https://agilemanifesto.org/), I think it is a guide to pragmatism. For example, one of the points is to favor responding to change over following a plan. I believe this is in response to some of the upfront requirements and design work that came out of the [waterfall method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model). It feels _prudent_ to spend a bunch of time before you write any code trying to map out the whole project. However, in practice, you can't predict the future and you can't plan for everything, so projects inevitably go off-plan. In practice, it is more _sensible_ to expect change and be ready to respond.

While I think the agile manifesto falls on the side of pragmatism, there is a meta-level of pragmatism that I think people don't always acknowledge:

> That is, while there is value in the items on the right,
> we value the items on the left more

A part of the wisdom and pragmatism of the Agile Manifesto is that it acknowledges it's not all one way.

### Takeaway

There is a _balance_ to things. This spectrum idea may start to break down when you consider that it may be _pragmatic_ to be _prudent_ at a certain point in time, but the point isn't about assigning a number on the pragmatic-prudent scale. The idea of this spectrum is to have a tool for thinking about your [biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) and using that self-awareness to make a better decision.

Maybe our industry (or at least people that include the authors of a book titled [_The Pragmatic Programmer_](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)) lean towards pragmatism, but it's important to acknowledge the balance and be mindful of where you are in comparison to where you want to be.

#### Suggestions

With the idea of this spectrum in mind, it can still be difficult to know which end you should be more focused on. I think one of the best tools that can help here is communication. Having clearly communicated goals and expectations for a project can be immensely valuable. If leadership has made it clear something is intended to be "a cut all frills MVP," "polished and Apple-like," or "launched into space and unable to receive software updates" it can serve as a guideline on when to be pragmatic and when to be prudent.

One strategy of communicating how time/focus/energy is expected to be put on a project is the idea of ["appetite"](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.2-chapter-03) from [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/)'s book, [_Shape Up_](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/):

> The first step of shaping is setting boundaries on what we’re trying to do. The conversations we have are going to be entirely different if people think we’re talking about a small improvement or a major redesign.
> (...)
> Whether we’re chomping at the bit or reluctant to dive in, it helps to explicitly define how much of our time and attention the subject deserves.
> (...)
> We call this the appetite.

While there is often pushback (and rightly so) against deadlines, there is some value to them. Again, from _Shape Up_:

> When you have a deadline, all of a sudden you have to make decisions

When a deadline is looming, you may shift into pragmatic mode. Long, hypothetical discussions may stop happening and discussions of cutting scope may start. However, as was said before, there's a balance to this, so be careful. You need to feel comfortable pushing back against deadlines when it's prudent to do so.

## Struggling versus Solving

The other tautogram that Charlie came up with when we were talking was about how to balance spending the time **struggling** to solve a problem and learning on your own with getting to a **solution** as quickly as possible.

In a [recent post](/2020/04/how-i-debug-my-dependencies#asking-for-help), I mentioned how I can struggle with asking for help, especially from open-source strangers. How much time should I spend trying to debug an issue with a third-party library and learning how it works before I should ask for help solving my problem?

While the above example uses asking a library author for help, that isn't the most common scenario. In fact, the more common example of this is asking your co-workers for help.

Personally, I tend to fall on the side of struggling. I try to justify this with the idea that there is [value in taking some time to struggle](https://news.stanford.edu/2019/09/30/embrace-struggle-education-professor-challenges-common-beliefs-teaching-learning/) and that it helps to better understand the eventual solution.  I am also sensitive to the high cost of [context switching](https://blog.rescuetime.com/context-switching/) and want to avoid inflicting that cost on my team.

Digging a little deeper, I think [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) is probably also at play. If I don't ask for help, no one will find out I'm a fraud. This type of thinking can slow me down and hold me back from growing.

If I get more comfortable knowing when I've struggled enough and should be getting help, I can spend less time spinning my wheels and more time learning, growing, and solving.

Being a new member of my team has put this balance to the test for me. Working on a new (for me), large codebase has resulted in numerous "how do I..." and "where is..." moments. For many of these, I have silently struggled - grepping across multiple repositories or jumping between Confluence and GitHub, when I could have pinged someone and probably would have had an answer to my question almost immediately. Fortunately, most of these problems haven't taken up too much time, but it can be a slippery slope; especially when not asking for help now makes it [harder for me to ask in the future](https://www.andymort.com/hard-asking-for-help/).

### Suggestions

#### Checking in with yourself

If I am hitting a bug, do I try to get help after an hour? A day? A week?  At what point would it be irresponsible to get help and lose out on growing my skillset? At what point would it be irresponsible to _not_ get assistance and get the problem solved? The question then becomes, how do I remember to ask myself these questions? For this, I would suggest leveraging some form of timeboxing or breaks.

If you think a bug should take you two hours, consider setting a timer or calendar appointment to check-in with yourself halfway through. Use this check-in point to ask yourself the following:

* Do I know how I can solve the problem?
* What is my new estimate?
* Would someone else be able to help me get this done sooner?
* How long would it take to get someone else up to speed?
* Have I struggled enough where if I get the answer given to me, it will stick?

You can even use existing breaks in work such as lunch or meetings as a chance to check-in with yourself. Using these stopping points provides an additional benefit - it's more likely your co-workers are also stopping at the same time. Since they aren't working on their own problems, it may be easier for them to make the [mental switch](https://heeris.id.au/2013/this-is-why-you-shouldnt-interrupt-a-programmer/) to help you with your problem.

The best times to check-in will vary - both by what you're working on and how you like to work. One technique I find valuable (when I remember to use it) is the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique). This technique uses set intervals of work time (25 minutes) followed by a few minutes of break time. Rather than having to plan ahead when you want to assess your current situation, the Pomodoro Technique gives you numerous stopping and checking-in points throughout your day.

#### Learning from help

If you find you reach out for help with a problem, that's not the end of the line. Try to fully take advantage of this learning opportunity.

Go beyond "getting the answer," and try to get insight into how the person approaches problem-solving. Ask them to share their thought process and how they work through solving the problem. This will often provide more insight than just figuring out how to solve your current problem.

## Conclusion

I don't expect that this post reveals anything new to people; [life is about balance and moderation](https://xkcd.com/1592/), and software is full of ["it depends" answers](https://softwareengineering.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/766/how-to-answer-it-depends-questions). I do, however, hope that it provides some useful vocabulary for thinking about how you approach solving problems.

Having these terms can provide a tool for observing your behavior or the behavior of those you work with. Maybe the next time you are dealing with a difficult problem at work you can take a step back and assess where you fall on the struggle-solve spectrum, and decide what to do next.

On top of inspiring this post, [@C-Saunders](https://github.com/c-saunders) read an early draft and suggested including some actionable suggestions around this topic (providing some helpful suggestions of his own). While I don't think this is something that can be "solved" all the way, I do hope some of the suggestions can help manage the balancing act of being pragmatic and prudent, and help you think about when it makes sense to keep struggling and when to start solving.
