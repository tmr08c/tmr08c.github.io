Inspired by the [Ruby Rouge's](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/) [picks section](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/picks) and [Tim Ferriss'](http://fourhourworkweek.com/) [5-Bullet Fridays](http://www.fourhournewsletter.com/site/fourhourworkweeknewsletter/webform.html?wid=6&u=w&mg_param3=4) I have decided to start creating short, weekly posts highlighting a few things that have piqued my interest recently.

For my first post I want to highlight [Spotify Running](https://www.spotify.com/us/running/). In the [past](/2015/05/why-i-love-the-cloud/) I have referenced [Strava](https://www.strava.com/), the app I use to track my runs. Similar to [Jerry Seinfeld's calendar trick](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret), having a record of my runs has definitely motivated me to go running, even when I wasn't feeling up to it. Spotify Running has also helped me with running by playing music that matches my running tempo.

From Spotify's site:

> Running in time with the music makes you feel more energetic, more motivated.

While this sounds like a marketing gimmick I have found there is definitely truth to it. The first time I tried it and saw how perfectly my steps were lining up with the beat I was invigorated.

Spotify Running allows you to pick a "theme" for your run. They have playlists with custom instrumentals as well as mixes featuring verses from popular tracks. I have enjoyed the *Power Run* playlist which features  "high intensity hip-hop, trap and dubstep"  but I actually prefer the custom instrumental playlists like *Blissed Out* and *Epic*.

Whether you are a regular runner or getting started check out the Running tab in your Spotify app and see how it feels to run in sync with your music.
