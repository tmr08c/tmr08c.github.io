Gabriel</a> (note, I copied the link from Jame Clear's newsletter which appears to be an affiliate link if that kind of thing bothers you).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In my life as an architect, I find that the single thing which inhibits\nyoung professionals, new students most severely, is their acceptance of\nstandards that are too low. If I ask a student whether her design is as good\nas Chartres, she often smiles tolerantly at me as if to say, 'Of course not,\nthat isn’t what I am trying to do. ... I could never do that.'</p>\n<p>Then, I express my disagreement, and tell her: 'That standard must be our\nstandard. If you are going to be a builder, no other standard is worthwhile.\nThat is what I expect of myself in my own buildings, and it is what I expect\nof my students.'</p>\n<p>Gradually, I show the students that they have a right to ask this of\nthemselves, and must ask this of themselves. Once that level of standard is\nin their minds, they will be able to figure out, for themselves, how to do\nbetter, how to make something that is as profound as that.</p>\n<p>Two things emanate from this changed standard. First, the work becomes more\nfun. It is deeper, it never gets tiresome or boring, because one can never\nreally attain this standard. One’s work becomes a lifelong work, and one\nkeeps trying and trying. So it becomes very fulfilling, to live in the light\nof a goal like this.</p>\n<p>But secondly, it does change what people are trying to do. It takes away from\nthem the everyday, lower-level aspiration that is purely technical in nature,\n(and which we have come to accept) and replaces it with something deep, which\nwill make a real difference to all of us that inhabit the earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This quote simultaneously makes me feel inspired and overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>My struggles with imposter syndrome are often the result of comparing myself to others. When I look at the success of someone else, I frequently end up feeling discouraged. I worry that I can never match their level of talent. In the quote, Christopher Alexander suggests using the work of others to inspire greatness in yourself instead. This shift in perspective aligns with the concept of <a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">fixed versus growth mindset</a>.</p>\n<p>With a fixed mindset, you think you have inherent talent (and lack thereof). With a fixed mindset, you will believe ideas like \"the person that made &#x3C;insert favorite library here> is a natural; I could never build something like that.\"  </p>\n<p>The fixed mindset mentality is highlighted perfectly in the quote. The fictional student is fixed in their belief that they will not get to a level rivaling historically significant architecture. A line that resonated with me was, \"that isn't what I am trying to do.\" I find that when I am in a fixed mindset, my ego will often put up a defense mechanism, and I will tell myself I'm not <em>actually</em> trying to be at the same level as some prominent developer. The truth is, I want to be a world-class developer. I want to be <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/books/so-good/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">so good, they can't ignore me</a>.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">according to the author of the book on mindset</a>, with a growth mindset you believe, \"talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others).\" </p>\n<p>With a growth mindset,  when you look at someone else's work and are impressed by it, you do not believe it was the result of some innate genius. You can see the hard work they put into developing their talents. With this mindset, you can look at work that you admire and become inspired to grow your skills in a way that can produce similar work. To quote Alexander, \"Once that level of standard is in their minds, they will be able to figure out, for themselves, how to do better, how to make something that is as profound as that.\"</p>\n<p>Even if the standard you are hoping to achieve feels too high, Alexander states that there is immense value in simply working towards it. Whether or not achieve your goals, the journey will cause a deeper fulfillment in your work and personal life. </p>\n<p>I wanted to write about this quote because it is changing my perspective and relationship with imposter syndrome.  I still struggle with comparing myself to others, and it still triggers my imposter syndrome. However, I am seeking opportunities to take a step back and view things through the lens of the growth mindset.  I am using the hard work and impressive results of others to inspire myself to work hard too. When you realize that everyone works hard to get where they are, looking at someone that you believe is successful can show you that what you want to achieve is possible. I want to fight against my insecurities and imposter syndrome and instead continue working on having a growth mindset. I want to use the amazing work of those around me to fuel my passion instead of smothering it. I want to strive for greatness in my lifelong pursuit of being a better software developer and person.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"A Quote Against Imposter Syndrome","date":"February 26, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021/02/a-quote-against-imposter-syndrome/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/01/receiving-code-review-feedback/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Receiving Code Review Feedback"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021/03/99-bottles-elixir/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Singing 99 Bottles of Elixir"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518","3649515864"]}
