Similar to how a <a href=\"https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">sprint retrospective</a> provides teams the opportunity to discuss how they are doing building software, this group has been using the retro format to discuss how they are doing building their lives. Specifically, they ask \"what went well, that we want to keep doing\" and \"what went poorly, that we want to do differently.\"</p>\n<p>During my first session, my answer to what went poorly was a feeling of being behind on my work tasks. More accurately, it was my reaction to this feeling. I tried to \"fix\" the problem by working more; this meant staying later and taking fewer, shorter breaks.</p>\n<p>This was far from the first time I tried taking the \"work more\" approach, and, sadly, even though I am writing myself a blog post to remember to do otherwise, it will not be the last. Despite countless reminders to \"work smarter, not harder,\" when a deadline is approaching, it is easy to fall into a mindset of throwing more time at the problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-right-amount-of-pressure\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-right-amount-of-pressure\" aria-label=\"the right amount of pressure permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Right Amount of Pressure</h2>\n<p>I acknowledge there are situations when working more is necessary. However, I believe these should be the exceptions, not the rule. While doing research for this post, I came across the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerkes%E2%80%93Dodson_law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Yerkes-Dodson law</a> which seems to align with my feeling of there being a \"line\" between good and bad amounts of pressure.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The law dictates that performance increases with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point. When levels of arousal become too high, performance decreases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Often represented as a bell curve, there appears to be a peak level of arousal (stress, pressure, excitement) beyond which your performance will decrease.</p>\n<figure>\n    <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HebbianYerkesDodson.svg#/media/File:HebbianYerkesDodson.svg\">\n        <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/HebbianYerkesDodson.svg\" alt=\"HebbianYerkesDodson.svg\" height=\"435\" width=\"765\">\n    </a>\n    <figcaption>\n        <i>\n            By Yerkes and Dodson, Hebbian - Diamond DM, et al.

To do this, I will turn to <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Cal Newport</a> (like I do for most things related to productivity) and his <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/14/on-deep-breaks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">deep breaks</a> concept.</p>\n<p>If you read his post about deep breaks, you may notice that it is less about what a deep break <em>is</em> and more about what it <em>isn't</em>. The goal of this style of break is to avoid switching to tasks that will leave <a href=\"https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/09/06/a-productivity-lesson-from-a-classic-arcade-game/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">attention residue</a>. When you shift your attention to something else, \"residue\" seems to stick around in your brain and make fully re-engaging with your previous work more difficult. The result is an overall decrease in performance.</p>\n<p>An example of a high attention residue context switch that I struggle with is the \"quick\" check of my email inbox or chat notifications. While I may spend less than a minute or two scanning my inbox, there is almost always something that catches my attention and lingers in my mind when I switch back to my original work.</p>\n<p>If you are already worried about getting enough work done, you may feel hamstrung by the idea of removing work-related tasks from your break time. While it may feel counterproductive, you should find this single-tasking strategy allows you to <a href=\"https://blog.rescuetime.com/single-tasking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">produce better work, often at a faster rate</a>. Remember, the goal is not to take a break from one task and work on another. The goal is to take a break away from work so you can resume with renewed vigor. You are trying to step back from over-arousal and move back into peak territory on the Yerkes-Dodson curve.</p>\n<p>When thinking about what to do during a break, we can turn to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/to-lose-weight-dont-just-avoid-temptation-remove-it/2018/10/26/eeb48238-d87f-11e8-a10f-b51546b10756_story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">dieting advice</a> \"don't resist temptation, remove it.\" Knowing that we want to avoid context switching during our break, we need to get away from attention-stealing situations. Namely, we need to get away from our computers (including our phones!). Don't test your ability to resist checking your email. Get away from your computer and all of the attention-stealing options it provides.</p>\n<h3 id=\"then-what-is-in-a-break\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#then-what-is-in-a-break\" aria-label=\"then what is in a break permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>...then what <em>is</em> in a break?</h3>\n<p>There are plenty of break-time options that will not result in attention residue. High on the list is \"nothing.\" It is perfectly okay to sit in a chair and stare off for ten minutes.</p>\n<p>Since shifting to remote work, I have found simple household tasks such as washing dishes or starting a load of laundry rank high on my list of break-time activities. They work particularly well for short intra-task breaks. These small household tasks work well for a few reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They don't shift my attention to cognitively demanding problems; I can let my brain rest.</li>\n<li>I don't particularly enjoy doing them; this means I'm not spending more time on them than necessary.</li>\n<li>They contribute to the <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-truisms-wellness/201607/the-powerful-psychology-behind-cleanliness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">positive psychological effects of cleanliness and organization</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Regardless of where I am working, my favorite break-time activity is getting outside and walking.

Habit stacking builds on the idea of specifying your intention, but ties the \"when\" aspect to an existing habit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Pomodoro® Technique</a> is a perfect example of this strategy. The general algorithm for the technique is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I will choose some work to do</li>\n<li>After I choose some work, I will set a timer</li>\n<li>After I set a timer, I will start working</li>\n<li>After the timer goes off, I will take a break</li>\n<li>After I take a break, I will repeat the process</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Rather than determining an exact time for your work or break, you base your actions on the previous step you took.</p>\n<p>Another example of habit stacking can be to plan around meetings. While not a habit in the way we traditionally talk about them, we often have meetings that we regularly attend. We can \"stack\" on these recurring meetings just like a habit. Consider the following, \"after stand up, I will take a 15-minute walking break.\" Breaking after a meeting can help clear the build-up of attention residue and reset your brain for other work.</p>\n<h4 id=\"time-block-planning\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#time-block-planning\" aria-label=\"time block planning permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Time-block Planning</h4>\n<p>Inspired by Cal Newport's release of a <a href=\"https://www.timeblockplanner.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">time-block planner</a>, I have been experimenting with his form of time-block planning.</p>\n<p>Time-block planning leverages the psychological effects of implementation intentions by pre-scheduling your time for your entire working day.</p>\n<p>One intention I have been trying to set for myself is a one-hour, mid-day lunch break.

A solid starting point is scheduling a recurring lunchtime break on your work calendar; this applies the foundations of intention setting and has the bonus effect of preventing others from scheduling during your allotted break time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Finding balance is difficult. It can be even more difficult in the midst of your work week when you are focused on getting your work done. Retrospectives can provide you with the opportunity to step back and better evaluate your ever-changing situation. In my case, I realized I was fanning the flames of burnout. Talking about the issues I was facing triggered me to learn more about pressure and productivity, the positive effects of breaks, and how to reinforce my break-taking habit.</p>\n<style class=\"grvsc-styles\">\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n  .tomorrow {\n    background-color: #FFFFFF;\n    color: #4D4D4C;\n  }\n  .tomorrow .grvsc-t564vY-11 { color: #8959A8; }\n  .tomorrow .grvsc-t564vY-1 { color: #4D4D4C; }\n  .tomorrow .grvsc-t564vY-9 { color: #C99E00; }\n  .tomorrow .grvsc-t564vY-6 { color: #3E999F; }\n  .tomorrow .grvsc-t564vY-8 { color: #C82829; }\n  .tomorrow .grvsc-line-highlighted::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05));\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2));\n  }\n  body.dark .grvsc-ps-tJmpaV {\n    background-color: #1D1F21;\n    color: #C5C8C6;\n  }\n  body.dark .grvsc-ps-tJmpaV .grvsc-tJmpaV-11 { color: #B294BB; }\n  body.dark .grvsc-ps-tJmpaV .grvsc-tJmpaV-1 { color: #C5C8C6; }\n  body.dark .grvsc-ps-tJmpaV .grvsc-tJmpaV-9 { color: #F0C674; }\n  body.dark .grvsc-ps-tJmpaV .grvsc-tJmpaV-6 { color: #8ABEB7; }\n  body.dark .grvsc-ps-tJmpaV .grvsc-tJmpaV-8 { color: #CC6666; }\n  body.dark .grvsc-ps-tJmpaV .grvsc-line-highlighted::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-background-color, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1));\n    box-shadow: inset var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-width, 4px) 0 0 0 var(--grvsc-line-highlighted-border-color, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5));\n  }\n</style>","frontmatter":{"title":"Taking Breaks","date":"February 27, 2022"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2022/02/taking-breaks/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2022/01/projectile-async-command/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Running Async Shell Commands with Projectile"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2022/03/ecto-explain/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"EXPLAIN Query with Ecto"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3128451518","3649515864"]}
