These benefits come from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Giving the author more time to flesh out and express their ideas.</p>\n<p>This allows the author to cover the topic more comprehensively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Avoiding disrupting the work of others.</p>\n<p>It's often unnecessary to immediately interrupt someone to discuss an idea. Avoid disrupting others (potentially reducing their quality of work) by sharing ideas in a format that can be consumed on their time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Giving consumers more time to think and respond.</p>\n<p>Just like it's often not necessary to interrupt someone to share an idea, it's also usually not necessary to give an immediate response.</p>\n<p>Asking a question in-person or via chat can set a tone of expecting prompt replies. Instead, we should be giving readers some time to think about the idea and form thoughtful feedback.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At work, we have started leveraging longer-form, asynchronous communication in the form of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBAR\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SBARs</a>. We are using the Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation format as the output of some of our more exploratory <a href=\"http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">spikes</a> on a new project. Since reviewers have more time to read and think about the recommendation, we have seen feedback that changed the recommendation and saved us from going down a potentially wrong path.</p>\n<p>Another benefit we have found is having an \"artifact\" that documents the discussion and decision. We can revisit the decision-making process to understand why we chose to go a certain way. I am optimistic this will be like <a href=\"https://github.com/ansman/git-praise\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><code>git praise</code></a>, but for larger decisions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"wanting-to-get-better\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#wanting-to-get-better\" aria-label=\"wanting to get better permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Wanting to get better</h2>\n<p>After hearing the suggestions and seeing some initial benefit of preferring written communication, I am striving to make it my preferred form of communication. Even when we are back in a more traditional office setting, I plan to maintain a bias towards asynchronous, written communication.</p>\n<p>Now that I am bought, I want to work to get better at it. For me better means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Faster - part of the benefit of this style of communication is taking the time to flesh out your thoughts, but I believe I have some opportunity around translating thoughts into words on a page more quickly.</li>\n<li>Clearer - with synchronous communication, if you don't make sense at first, the person can immediately ask you to clarify. You lose out on this quick iteration with asynchronous communication. Ideally, taking the upfront time to flesh out the writing can help avoid these issues.</li>\n<li>More varied - while I keep calling it \"written\" communication, it doesn't have to be all text on the screen. There are times when images, charts, diagrams, etc. could be included to better communicate a point. I want to be able to leverage these additional tools when they would improve the ability to deliver my message.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One way I am trying to improve my written communication is through practice; specifically, by writing more blog posts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deliberate-practice\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#deliberate-practice\" aria-label=\"deliberate practice permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>(Deliberate) Practice</h2>\n<p>To get better, I need to practice.</p>\n<p>With writing, a common suggestion is to <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-mission/the-daily-routine-of-20-famous-writers-and-how-you-can-use-them-to-succeed-1603f52fbb77#:~:text=Stephen%20King%20writes%206%20pages,it&#x27;s%20just%20another%20day&#x27;s%20work.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">write every day</a>.

The article specifically calls out deliberate practice as not doing something you do well and enjoy doing.</li>\n<li><strong>Driven by good goals</strong> - Goals should focus on the <em>process</em> of getting to the outcome and not just the outcome alone.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"how-am-i-doing\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#how-am-i-doing\" aria-label=\"how am i doing permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How Am I Doing</h3>\n<p>How does my current attempt at writing more through blogging stack up against the traits of good deliberate practice?</p>\n<h4 id=\"designed-to-improve-performance\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#designed-to-improve-performance\" aria-label=\"designed to improve performance permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Designed to improve performance</h4>\n<p>Clear and succinct, long-form writing to a wider audience is currently pushing beyond my limits.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, through practice, this will become easier for me.
